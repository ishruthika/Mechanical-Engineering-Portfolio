        MAXIMUM RATIO OF MATRIX DIAGONAL TO FACTOR DIAGONAL =  2.8E+09 AT ROW NUMBER     493989
     User information:
     One, two or three of the statistics will be printed as follows:
     (1) negative terms on factor  diagonal only if they exist; (2) maximum
     ratio only if it exceeds a threshold defined by the parameter MAXRATIO
     (default 1.0E7);  (3) spill rows only if the problem spills.
     Depending on the context, these messages may indicate modeling
     problems. The threshold may be changed with the parameter MAXRATIO,
     however, the user is cautioned against arbitrarily increasing the
     MAXRATIO value just to get the model to run.  The cause of large
     MAXRATIOs should be investigated.
     This message is also generated (though the text is slightly different)
     when a Sturm check is performed during eigenvalue extraction. For this
     case, the message does not generally indicate a modeling problem.
     See the NASTRAN Installation and Operation Instructions for
     a discussion of these statistics.  See also the NASTRAN Numerical
     Methods User's Guide.
